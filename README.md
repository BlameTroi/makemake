# makemake for Fortran

This repository is contains a mirror of the versin of `makemake` from the University of Virginia. It's in Perl, which I don't really know, and doesn't recurse directory structures. For that, there is [makemake90](https://github.com/janberges/makemake90), a more recent Python 3 script. 

## AUTHORSHIP, LICENSING, AND COPYRIGHT

The original `makemake` was created by Michael Wester of the University of New Mexico in 1995. This version is reported as being last updated by Katherine Holcomb of the University of Virginia in 2011. There are no official copyright or license notices that I could find, so I include the following from the [UVA page](https://learning.rc.virginia.edu/courses/fortran-introduction/make/) that pointed me at `makemake`:

> Makemake is a Perl script first developed by Michael Wester soon after the introduction of Fortran 90, in order to construct correct makefiles for modern Fortran code. The version supplied here has been extended. It is freely licensed but if you use it, please do not remove the credits at the top.

I'm not sure what to call that, maybe GPL or MIT? I always release my work as public domain via the unlicense:
some or all of the code in this project is by Troy Brumley (BlameTroi). Prior work preserves its original licensing and author copyrights. My work is Copyright 2024 by Troy Brumley, all rights reserved, and licensed under the UNLICENSE.

So let it be written. So let it be done.
